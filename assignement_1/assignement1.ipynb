    "### Task 3 - In addition to maximizing reaction rate (‚Äúflux‚Äù) through some reaction of biological interest, like the biomass reaction, we can use Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) optimizations also to ask: What are the smallest and largest fluxes possible per reaction, given all present constraints in the network? This is known as ‚ÄúFlux Variabiliry Analysis‚Äù or FVA. In FVA, we loop over every reaction of interest and once maximize and once minimize its flux via FBA; thus obtaining the permissible flux range for each reaction in the model."

    "A set of reactions that exhibit such behavior may be necessary to maintain critical cellular functions, such as metabolic balance, production of vital metabolites, or regulation of essential biochemical processes. As a result, these reactions are forced to maintain a positive flow even under minimal conditions so that the cell can continue to perform these important tasks."
