For this we use the non-interactive version:https://escher.github.io/#/app?map=e_coli_core.Core%20metabolism&tool=Builder&scrollToZoom=true&model=e_coli_core. In order to load the data, go to ‚ÄúData ü°™ ‚ÄúLoad reaction data‚Äù and load the file. The data will then be visualized in the same way that we inspected actual flux predictions in the interactive session in Week 1."

    "- **Why no gene expression data**: This reaction is an exchange reaction, that represents a system boundary in the metabolic model, not a specific enzymatic reaction. It defines the interface between the extracellular compartment and the cellular one. While actual glucose transport involves specific transporters, the exchange reaction is purely a mathematical construct.\n",

    "- **Why no gene expression data**: This reaction represents the overall cellular energy cost for maintaining basic cellular functions (protein turnover, DNA repair, etc) It's not catalyzed by a single enzyme, it just represents the overall ATP consumption from hundreds of different maintenance processes occurring simultaneously in the cell.\n",
    "- **Gene association**: Has zero associated genes because it's a mathematical representation of energy drain rather than a specific enzymatic reaction. You cannot measure gene expression for \"cellular maintenance\" as a whole - it's the sum of many different processes.\n",
